# Convolutional Networks and Image Processing

## Description
1. **Downloaded dataset in 'dataset' folder:**  
   [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nzVk4GOvKR6P87uPszUkKMPtaXV_wrZf)  

2. **Build a classification model for the images in the dataset (cats and dogs).**  
   To achieve this, sequentially implement:
   - **a)** A fully connected network with three hidden layers for image classification (input: one-dimensional vector).  
   - **b)** A convolutional neural network (CNN) with two convolution and subsampling blocks for the same purpose.  

3. **Implement transfer learning using VGG19 and ResNet models.**  
   Utilize pre-trained model weights by freezing the fully connected layers and fine-tuning them with the new dataset.  

4. **Compare the performance of the models.**  

5. **Increase the number of training epochs for models (a) and (b), and plot learning curves to illustrate the phenomenon of overfitting.**
